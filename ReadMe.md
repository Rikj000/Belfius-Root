Simple Xposed module to support the Belfius app on Rooted devices!

## Installation
1. Install [Magisk](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html)
2. Magisk => Settings => Magisk => Check `Zygisk`
3. Install [LSPosed (Zygisk) + Shamiko](https://lsposed.org/)
4. Install the [Belfius-Root](https://github.com/Rikj000/Belfius-Root/releases) app
5. LSPosed => Modules => `Belfius Root` => Check `Enable module` + Check `Belfius Mobile`
6. Reboot

## Motivation

Belfius bank was pretty cool about having a rooted device in the past,   
they just threw a dismissible warning about security risks of using a rooted device,   
and then allowed you to keep using their app.

However on 2024-07-01 this changed.   
Nowadays they assume that you're an idiot that will not be able to keep your own device safe if you have root.

I do not agree with that assumption, and likely neither do you.   
Only power users that have a good idea of what they're doing tend to root their own devices.

After only a hand full of transactions, done through the tedious browser process,   
I grew agitated enough to do the research to write this module.

Hope you'll enjoy this module and the ability to stay rooted!
